- Use GIT style version control

Two tables for every version controlled table:
- Tree
- Versions

Tree contains json of version control history for that row
{
    id: xxxx,
    current: 1.1.3,
    conflicts: [],
    tree: [
        {version: 0, date: xxx, parent: id, props: {}, forks: []}
        {version: 1, date: xxx, parent: id, props: {}, forks: [
            [
                {version: 1.0.0, date: xxx, parent: id, props: {}, forks: []},
                {version: 1.0.1, date: xxx, parent: id, props: {}, forks: []},
                {version: 1.0.2, date: xxx, parent: id, props: {}, forks: []}
            ],
            [
                {version: 1.1.0, date: xxx, parent: id, props: {}, forks: []},
                {version: 1.1.1, date: xxx, parent: id, props: {}, forks: [
                    [
                        {version: 1.1.1.0.0, date: xxx, parent: id, props: {}, forks: []}
                    ]
                ]},
                {version: 1.1.2, date: xxx, parent: id, props: {}, forks: []}
            ]
        ]}
        {version: 2, date: xxx, parent: id, props: {}, hash: xxx, forks: []}
    ]
}
